        {`I'm Guilherme, and my love for programming began at the age of 13 when 
        I took a web design course in my hometown, Prudentópolis, in the 
        interior of Paraná, Brazil. At 17, I decided to pursue my passion and 
         moved to Alegrete, Rio Grande do Sul, a thousand kilometers away from
          everything I knew, to study Software Engineering at Unipampa. It was
           an incredible journey that brought me here.`}

        {`Currently, I work as a back-end developer with a degree in 
        Software Engineering. I have a deep appreciation for seeing a 
        "status 200" after completing an API, but I also enjoy the art
        of creating a beautiful front-end.`}

        {`My quest for growth extends beyond just programming; I am committed 
        to evolving in areas like leadership and management, as I believe a
         good software engineer should be versatile and understand the full
          spectrum of software development.`}

        {`What truly motivates me is problem-solving. I believe it's 
        in challenging situations that we learn and grow the most.
        I'm looking forward to bringing my passion for programming 
        and my thirst for learning.`}
